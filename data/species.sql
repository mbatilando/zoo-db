INSERT INTO "Species" VALUES(1132, 'Puma concolor', 'Small Cats', 'Like the unicorn, small cats have been the stuff of legends. Many of these cats have never been studied in their natural habitats, which are often in rugged, remote areas. Some small cats are active only at night, making it hard for researchers to study them. Until recently, the bay cat of Borneo was known to exist only in stories and identified by a few skins in museums; it was not studied in the wild until the late 1990s! There are reports of a cat known only as the onza, from Mexico, which may be related to the mountain lion. It is as big as a mountain lion but more slender. Scientists have only seen one, which had been killed by hunters.');
INSERT INTO "Species" VALUES(1133, 'Python reticulatus', 'Snake', 'Snakes, by and large, get a bum rap. Many people have a deep fear of these reptiles. Their long, slender bodies and lack of legs, eyelids, or ear flaps distinguish snakes from all other reptiles. They are covered with back-folded and pliable skin sections called scales. The skin between the scales is called interstitial skin. Like their reptile brethren, they use the heat of the surrounding air to regulate their body temperature. A flexible body allows snakes to stretch out to warm up quickly, to curl up to conserve body heat, or just to warm a particular part of the body.');

Although the cats freely cross the international boundaries of 12 countries, their secretive behavior and remote habitat among the highest mountains in the world add to their mystery. Because of their shy behavior and uncanny, almost mystical ability to disappear among the rocks, snow leopards have entered the folklore of local peoples in many countries and have been described as shape-changing mountain spirits.');

All wild asses differ from horses and zebras in their smaller size, larger ears, tufted tail, stiff mane, and characteristic loud bray. Found in some of the most unlivable habitats of Africa and Asia, wild asses are able to eke out a living and thrive where most animals could not. African wild asses are divided into two subspecies: Somali and Nubian wild asses. Until recently, both were found in the wild, but it is possible that only the Somali wild ass remains.');

But only a few species are dangerous to humans, and even then they won''t bite unless they feel threatened. Spiders are not insects, and they are different in many ways. For example, spiders have two body parts: the front body section, called the cephalothorax (seff-a-la-THOR-ax), and an abdomen; insects have three body parts: a head, thorax, and abdomen. Spiders have eight legs while insects have six, and, in general, spiders have "simple" eyes instead of the "compound" eyes that give many insects much better vision.');

The toad’s skin is pointy, rough, and is colored a mottled brown, tan, or olive. Each finger on its forelimbs has a tiny, star-shaped tip, leading to the animal’s other name, star-fingered toad.
