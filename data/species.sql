  (1000, 'Tremarctos ornatus', 'Andean (Spectacled) Bear', 'The Andean bear of South America is also known as the spectacled bear for the rings of white or light fur around its eyes, which can look like eyeglasses (or spectacles) against the rest of the bear’s black or dark brown fur. These markings often extend down the chest, giving each bear a unique appearance and helping researchers identify each bear by its "mug shot"! The markings also give the bear its scientific name: Tremarctos ornatus, or decorated bear.'),
  (1001, 'Vultur gryphus', 'Andean Condor', 'The Andean condor is the largest raptor in the world and the largest flying bird in South America. It flies majestically over the mountains and valleys of the Andes. This bird of prey and its close cousin, the California condor, are part of the New World vultures, a group of birds more closely related to storks than to the vultures of Africa.'),
  (1002, 'Haliaeetus leucocephalus', 'Bald Eagle', 'The founders of the United States wanted a bird to symbolize a nation they hoped would be strong and powerful, one that could soar high in the sky to represent freedom. They chose the bald eagle, an eagle species found only in North America. You can see images of bald eagles on coins, stamps, and much more.'),
  (1003, 'Leucopsar rothschildi', 'Bali Myna', 'The Bali myna is a beautiful, snow-white bird with black tips on wing and tail feathers and striking sky-blue patches of skin around its eyes. The male and female are almost identical, although the delicate, lacy head crest extending down the back of the neck may be a bit longer on the male. Its beauty is probably why this birds likeness is used in much of the cultural art found on the island of Bali in Indonesia. The Bali myna or Bali starling is found in one small region of Bali, an island that is smaller than the size of Rhode Island.'),
  (1004, 'Otocyon megalotis', 'Bat-eared Fox', 'The bat-eared fox is a small, African fox known for its enormous ears, which are over 5 inches (13 centimeters) tall. The ears are full of blood vessels that shed heat and help keep the fox cool; they also give the animal a very good sense of hearing.'),
  (1005, 'Arctictis binturong', 'Binturong', 'It’s a binturong! Looking like something Dr. Seuss might have dreamed up, a binturong has a face like a cats and a body like a bears, long, shaggy black hair, stiff white whiskers, and a prehensile tail that’s as long as its body. Binturongs are also called bearcats, but that name is rather misleading since these animals are not related to bears OR cats. Instead, they are related to civets and fossas but look more like gigantic dust mops and smell like a freshly made batch of popcorn!'),
  (1006, 'Pan paniscus', 'Bonobo', 'The bonobo is one of the most rare and intelligent animals in the world. The social structure of this magnificent ape is unique and complex: in the largely peaceful bonobo society, the females rule the roost. Bonobos are members of the great ape family, along with gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees. Earlier scientists thought the bonobo was just a smaller version of the common chimpanzee and so the term “pygmy chimpanzee” was used. But don’t be fooled! Bonobos and chimpanzees are really quite different—you just need to know what to look for.'),
  (1007, 'Ursus arctos', 'Brown Bear', 'Brown bears are brown, right? Well, maybe! They come in all sizes and shades, from a light cream color to almost black. It was once thought that there were 86 different kinds of grizzlies and brown bears in North America alone. Today, scientists agree that there is only one species of brown bear with a lot of variations (or subspecies)! Bears found in parts of coastal Alaska are called Kodiak or Alaskan brown bears and tend to be the largest of the species. This is from eating salmon rich in fat every summer. The Alaskan Peninsular brown bear has a much smaller range, just the western tip of the Alaskan peninsula. Brown bears in interior North America are known as grizzly bears because their brown fur is tipped with white or tan; the word "grizzly” means "sprinkled or streaked with gray."'),
  (1008, 'Gymnogyps californianus', 'California Condor', 'California condors are one of the largest flying birds. They are known for their enormous black wings, extraordinary eyesight, and an inquisitive and engaging intelligence. At one time there were thousands of California condors in the wild across the western United States and into Mexico.  Fossil records indicate that these birds once inhabited present-day Florida and New York as well. Native American tribes have great respect for the condor and see it as a symbol of power. They call it the thunderbird because they believe the bird brings thunder to the skies with the beating of its huge wings. It can be distinguished in flight from other vultures by the large, triangular white patch under each wing.'),
  (1009, 'Caracal caracal', 'Caracal', 'With their sleek, streamlined body, short, reddish gold coat, and dramatic markings on the face, caracals are among the most beautiful of wild cats. Also called the desert lynx, medium-sized caracals have no spots or stripes and have longer legs and a slimmer body than a true lynx. Caracals are the heaviest and also the fastest of the small cats and are the largest of the small cats in Africa.'),
  (1010, 'Acinonyx jubatus', 'Cheetah', 'If ever an animal was born to run, it’s the cheetah. People have marveled at this fastest of land mammals for thousands of years. Egyptian tombs and rock temples show representations of the cheetah, and many ancient cultures used the cheetah for its hunting prowess, much the way falcons are used in many countries to accompany hunters. The cheetah has adorned the courts of kings, queens, and emperors, and its amazing grace and beauty still captive the world today.'),
  (1011, 'Pan troglodytes', 'Chimpanzee', 'Chimpanzees are very familiar to us humans, perhaps because so much of their behavior reminds us of ourselves. They are considered great apes, just like gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos. Their distinctive mode of travel—walking on the sole of each foot and the knuckles of their hands—have earned them the title of knuckle-walkers.'),
  (1012, 'Stephanoaetus coronatus', 'Crowned Eagle', 'Crowned eagles are not the largest eagles in Africa—martial eagles claim that title—but they are the most powerful. Their legs are thick, and they have a very long talon on each back toe that helps them kill animals more than four times their size. Crowned eagles live in the tall woodland forests and rain forests of Africa. They are often seen on Africas savannas as well. Built for flying among trees, the crowned eagles wings are short and broad, and its long tail helps guide the bird like a rudder guides a boat. These features allow the eagle to fly easily through the branches.'),
  (1013, 'Gopherus agassizii', 'Desert Tortoise', 'If you’ve ever visited the Mojave or Sonoran desert in California and saw a tortoise scooting across the sand, you most likely saw a desert tortoise. This tortoise species is a slow-growing, long-lived animal that has changed little during the past 200 million years. It is the largest terrestrial turtle in the United States and is a keystone species in the Mojave Desert ecosystem, providing burrows for other animals and dispersing seeds from eating the plants and grasses there.'),
  (1014, 'Cuon alpinus', 'Dhole', 'The dhole (pronounced "dole") is also known as the Asiatic wild dog, red dog, and whistling dog. It is about the size of a German shepherd but looks more like a long-legged fox. This highly elusive and skilled jumper is classified with wolves, coyotes, jackals, and foxes in the taxonomic family Canidae.'),
  (1015, 'Dromaius novaehollandiae', 'Emu', 'Tall and majestic, the emu belongs to a group of flightless running birds known as ratites, the most primitive of the modern bird families. The ratite family includes the kiwi, ostrich, cassowary, and rhea, all birds found only in the Southern Hemisphere. The emu is the second-largest living bird in the world (the ostrich is the largest). Adult female emus are larger and heavier than the males.'),
  (1016, 'Prionailurus viverrinus', 'Fishing Cat', 'Cats don’t like water, and they definitely don’t swim, right? Well, that’s only true of some cats—others actually love the water! Fishing cats are one of the best swimmers around and are completely at home in the water. Cats are supposed to roam the land while hunting small terrestrial animals, but sometimes you want to be something different!'),
  (1017, 'Cryptoprocta ferox', 'Fossa', 'At first glance, a fossa looks like some kind of cat, monkey, or weasel. It has paws with claws like a cat, a long tail like a monkey, and round little ears like a weasel, so its easy to be confused! Although it shares some adaptive similarities with cats, the fossa is closely related to the mongoose and civet. Its coat is short and dense, usually a rich brown color with a golden tinge and a lighter-colored belly. The fossas tail makes up about half of the animals length!'),
  (1018, 'Chelonoidis nigra', 'Galápagos Tortoise', 'Galápagos tortoises are the giants of the tortoise world. Males can weigh more than 500 pounds (227 kilograms), and females average about 250 pounds (113 kilograms). They have thick, sturdy legs to hold up all that weight, but they still spend a lot of time lying down to conserve energy. There are two types of Galápagos tortoises. The largest, with big, round shells, are called “domes.” The smaller kinds of tortoises have shells that curl up in front like a saddle and are called “saddlebacks.”'),
  (1019, 'Myrmecophaga tridactyla', 'Giant Anteater', 'Its name is a hint to one of its favorite foods, and you cant miss its long snout, but theres more to the story of the giant anteater! This unique animal is the largest of the three anteater species (the other two are the tamandua or lesser anteater and the silky anteater). The giant anteater is about the size of a golden retriever, but thick, bushy hair makes it look even bigger.'),
  (1020, 'Ailuropoda melanoleuca', 'Giant Panda', 'The giant panda is a national treasure in China and is therefore protected by law in its bamboo forest home. This unique bear has long been revered by the Chinese and can be found in Chinese art dating back thousands of years. The Chinese call their beloved pandas large bear-cats. Giant pandas have also fascinated people living outside of China; French Missionary Pere Armand David first described them for science in 1869. Now, more than 100 years later, the worldwide love for pandas has been combined with international efforts to keep them from becoming extinct.'),
  (1021, 'Heloderma suspectum', 'Gila Monster', 'As the name might suggest, the Gila (pronounced HEE-la) monster has one of the worst reputations in the reptile world. This lizard is often feared and has been described as frightful and repulsive, especially in local folklore. It has been accused of many things, such as spitting venom, leaping several feet in the air to attack, stinging with its tongue, and killing people with gusts of poisonous breath. We’re glad you’re reading this fact sheet to learn the truth about these interesting lizards!'),
  (1022, 'Giraffa camelopardalis', 'Giraffe', 'Why do so many people look up to giraffes—besides the obvious reason? The long and short of it is that they are a wonderful example of nature’s creativity.'),
  (1023, 'Aquila chrysaetos', 'Golden Eagle', 'The golden eagle is a large bird of prey that belongs to the hawk and eagle family. With broad, rounded wings, the colors of the eagles feathers range from black-brown to dark brown. But its the striking golden head and neck that give the bird its common name.'),
  (1024, 'Conraua goliath', 'Goliath Frog', 'Were not kidding—the goliath frog is the largest frog in the world. It grows up to 12.5 inches (32 centimeters) long and can weigh up to 7.2 pounds (3.3 kilograms). The goliath frog is as big as some house cats!'),
  (1025, 'Erythrura gouldiae', 'Gouldian Finch', 'Gouldian finches are also commonly referred to as rainbow finches or simply Goulds. They are among the most brilliantly colored birds in existence. Not sure what to look for? Look for a community of kaleidoscopic colors, and you have found Gouldian finches!'),
  (1026, 'Gallirallus owstoni', 'Guam Rail', 'The Guam rail is native to Guam in the western Pacific Ocean and is found nowhere else in the world. Most rails are somber and solid in color, but the Guam rail has dark brown and white stripes called bars beneath a plain mantel of light brown, shading to buff on the neck. A white eye stripe draws attention to the narrow, blackish bill. Its medium-length legs are strong, and the long toes help the bird to walk over grasses and soft marsh mud. Its narrow body is an adaptation for running through thick marsh grass, weeds, and underbrush.'),
  (1027, 'Lama guanicoe', 'Guanaco', 'Guanacos are graceful animals related to camels. Pronounced "gwa NAH ko," they live throughout South America in dry, open country in the mountains or on the plains. Guanacos have a calm attitude, so people started to domesticate them for use as pack animals. The result is the llama of today, which is the domesticated version of the guanaco—llamas don’t exist in the wild. Another branch of the family tree is the alpaca, which is also a type of domesticated guanaco raised for its soft wool.'),
  (1028, 'Harpia harpyja', 'Harpy Eagle', 'The harpy eagle is legendary, although few people have seen one in the wild. Early South American explorers named these great birds after harpies, the predatory “frightful, flying creatures with hooked beak and claws” of Greek mythology. This dark gray bird of prey has a very distinctive look, with feathers atop its head that fan into a bold crest when the bird feels threatened. Some smaller gray feathers create a facial disk that may focus sound waves to improve the bird’s hearing, similar to owls.'),
  (1029, 'Hippopotamus amphibious', 'Hippo', 'Watch a hippo, on land or in the water, and you’ll soon discover that this roly-poly is one of the animal world’s great characters. It is the most rotund land mammal and spends its daytime hours in lakes, pools, mudholes, or in the preferred moving waters of rivers.'),
  (1030, 'Mellivora capensis', 'Honey Badger (Ratel)', 'The honey badger is part of the weasel family, related to skunks, otters, ferrets, and other badgers. Its proper name is ratel, but it gets the common name honey badger from what seems to be its favorite food: honey. Yet what the animal is actually looking to eat are the bee larvae found in the honey!'),
  (1031, 'Panthera onca', 'Jaguar', 'Sleek, powerful, and elusive, jaguars stalk the Americas and are revered by all who share their realm. Their mesmerizing gaze and hunting prowess have earned them a prominent place in mythology and legend. Their beauty, strength, and adaptability have earned them the respect of feline admirers around the world. Jaguars are some pretty cool cats.'),
  (1032, 'Rhynochetos jubatus', 'Kagu', 'With its pearl-gray feathers, bright orange legs and bill, brilliant red eyes, a head crest like a cockatoo’s, and bold stripes on its wingtips, the kagu has a most unusual look for a bird that lives on the ground. This rare, flightless bird is from the forests of New Caledonia’s main island, in the South Pacific. About the size of a chicken, the kagu lives in rain forests as well as drier forests. It has specialized feathers called powder downs; these feathers make a powder that cleans and waterproofs the kagu in its wet habitat. Although it is similar to herons and egrets, the kagu has no known close relatives.'),
  (1033, 'Potos flavus', 'Kinkajou', 'The kinkajou (pronounced KINK ah joo) lives in tropical rain forests from southern Mexico through Brazil. Its small, hand-like feet have fingers that are a bit webbed and end with sharp little claws. Dense, wooly fur acts as a raincoat to help keep the animal dry. The kinkajou’s tail is longer than its head and body and is thickly furred and slightly prehensile.'),
  (1034, 'Phascolarctos cinereus', 'Koala', 'Have you ever heard someone refer to a koala as a "koala bear?" Well, like bears, koalas are mammals, and they have round, fuzzy ears and look cute and cuddly, like a teddy bear. But koalas are not bears. They are members of a group of pouched animals called marsupials. Marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, wallaroos, wombats, possums, and opossums. Koalas look soft, but their fur feels like the coarse wool of a sheep. They also seem cuddly, but koalas are wild animals and dont make good pets.'),
  (1035, 'Varanus komodoensis', 'Komodo Dragon', 'There are over 3,000 lizard species, but the Komodo dragon wins the prize for being the largest living lizard in the world! It is a type of monitor lizard, an ancient species of reptile with ancestors that date back more than 100 million years. Komodo dragons were unknown by western scientists until 1912, and their common name came from rumors of a large dragon-like lizard occurring in the Lesser Sunda Islands. Indeed the yellow color of the Komodo dragon’s long, forked tongue reminds people of mythical dragons that spit fire!'),
  (1036, 'Dacelo novaeguineae', 'Laughing Kookaburra', 'The laughing kookaburra is the largest member of the kingfisher family and was once called the giant kingfisher. Most kingfishers are brightly colored—often blue or green—and many of them specialize in diving into streams and ponds to catch fish. The laughing kookaburra, however, is plainly colored and rarely eats fish! It has a light beige or white head and breast with brown wings and back. The head has a brown stripe like a mask crossing each eye. The beak is heavy and boat-shaped. The kookaburra’s breast has pale gray, wavy lines, and the outsides of the wings are speckled with pale blue dots. The male laughing kookaburra often has blue above the base of the tail. Both sexes have a rusty red tail with black bars and white tips. The female is slightly larger than the male.'),
  (1037, 'Panthera pardus', 'Leopard', 'The leopard is the epitome of stealth. Its very name brings mental pictures of this great spotted cat crouched on a tree limb awaiting the approach of a gazelle, or of a sleek, spotted body slipping silently through the dry savanna grass with scarcely a ripple as it nears its chosen target. Silence and stealth are the trademarks of this ultimate predator.'),
  (1038, 'Panthera leo', 'Lion', 'Lions have captured our imagination for centuries. Stars of movies and characters in books, lions are at the top of the food chain. The Swahili word for lion, simba, also means "king," "strong," and "aggressive." The word lion has similar meaning in our vocabulary. If you call someone lionhearted, you’re describing a courageous and brave person. If you lionize someone, you treat that person with great interest or importance.'),
  (1039, 'Mandrillus sphinx', 'Mandrill', 'Mandrills are the largest and most colorful of the Old World monkeys. They are related to baboons and even more so to drills. Their furry head crest, mane, and beard are quite impressive. But what grabs your attention is their bright coloration. They have thick ridges along the nose that are purple and blue, red lips and nose, and a golden beard. It almost looks like they’re not real!'),
  (1040, 'Puma concolor', 'Mountain Lion (Puma, Cougar)', 'Mountain lion, puma, cougar, panther—this cat is known by more names than just about any other mammal! But no matter what you call it, it’s still the same cat, Puma concolor, the largest of the small cat species. So how did it get so many names? Mostly because it has such a large range, and people from different countries have called it different things.'),
  (1041, 'Heterocephalus glaber', 'Naked Mole-rat', 'The forbidding environment of East Africa’s deserts is home to one of the most bizarre rodents, the naked mole-rat. These beauties wouldn’t win any pageants, but they are fascinating animals. Yes, these odd little creatures with pink, wrinkly skin dig and live in underground burrows the way moles do. Yes, they have skinny, rat-like tails. Yet naked mole-rats are more closely related to porcupines, chinchillas, and guinea pigs than they are to moles or rats and are the only species of mole-rat that has practically no hair.'),
  (1042, 'Kobus megaceros', 'Nile Lechwe', 'Most people in this part of the world have never heard of a Nile lechwe (pronounced LETCH-way or LEECH-wee). Lechwe belong to a family of African antelope known as Reduncines. Nile lechwe are native to the floodplains of the Nile River Valley. Most of the wild population lives in southern Sudan, with the remaining in western Ethiopia. The "Nile" part of their name tells you where they are from, but where in the world does the word lechwe come from? Lechwe is a Bantu word meaning antelope, a good name for the antelope calling the Nile River Valley home.'),
  (1043, 'Leopardus pardalis', 'Ocelot', 'An ocelot is a small cat from the New World. It ranges from the very southern region of Texas all the way to northern Argentina in South America. The ocelot has one of the most beautiful coats of any animal in the world. Its fur is golden over most of its body, with white or cream on the belly; splashed over the background color are all sorts of patterns!'),
  (1044, 'Okapia johnstoni', 'Okapi', 'The okapi (pronounced oh-COP-ee) is a beautiful and unusual animal. With its white-and-black striped hindquarters and front legs, it looks like it must be related to zebras! But take a look at an okapi’s head, and you’ll notice a resemblance to giraffes. The okapi is indeed the only living relative of the giraffe. Like a giraffe, the okapi has very large, upright ears, which catch even slight sounds, helping the animal avoid trouble. The okapi also has a long, dark, prehensile tongue, just like a giraffe’s, to help it strip the buds and young leaves from the understory brush of its rain forest home.'),
  (1045, 'Struthio camelus', 'Ostrich', 'The ostrich is the largest and heaviest living bird. As its species name, camelus, suggests, the ostrich was once known as the “camel bird” because of its long neck, prominent eyes, and sweeping eyelashes, as well as its jolting walk. Also, like camels, the ostrich can tolerate high temperatures and go without water for long periods of time. Native to Africa, ostriches are found in savanna and desert regions, were they graze among giraffes, zebras, wildebeest, and gazelles.'),
  (1046, 'Lycaon pictus', 'Painted Dog', 'African painted dogs are classified in the Canidae, or true dog, family along with jackals, foxes, coyotes, wolves, dingoes, and domestic dogs. They are frequently mistaken as hyenas. However, hyenas are different enough to be in a separate taxonomic family, Hyaenidae. Found in the open plains and savannas of Africa, painted dogs can also live and thrive in thicker bush and forest areas.'),
  (1047, 'Atelopus zeteki', 'Panamanian Golden Frog', 'Not so long ago, on a mountain in a forest on a small spit of land, there lived a beautiful little frog. The frog was bright golden yellow with inky black patches and lived near a swiftly flowing river. He spent his days climbing trees or ambling to the water’s edge and waving to his friends. Even though he was brightly colored, the frog was well hidden in his forest home.'),
  (1048, 'Ursus maritimus', 'Polar Bear', 'Perhaps no other animal symbolizes the frozen tundra regions of the Earth as do polar bears. They live on ice and snow, but that’s not a problem—these bears have some cool ways to stay warm!'),
  (1049, 'Antilocapra americana', 'Pronghorn', 'The pronghorn is an original Native American. It has no close relative on this or any other continent. This interesting animal goes by many names: pronghorn antelope, prongbuck, and American antelope. The pronghorn is often called an antelope, and it does look like many antelope species. Yet it is different enough to warrant its own taxonomic family, Antilocapridae. Read on to learn more about this one-of-a-kind critter!'),
  (1050, 'Choeropsis liberiensis', 'Pygmy Hippopotamus', 'At first glance, the pygmy hippopotamus looks like a mini version of its larger relative, the hippopotamus (also known as the river or common hippopotamus). But it differs in behavior and physical characteristics. The pygmy hippo has adaptations for spending time in the water but is much less aquatic than the hippo. Its nose and ears close underwater just like a hippos do, but its head is rounder and narrower, its neck is proportionally longer, and its eyes are not on the top of its head.'),
  (1051, 'Callithrix pygmaea', 'Pygmy Marmoset', 'High in the rain forest canopy of South America lives a tiny animal. It dodges behind tree trunks and branches, freezing and dashing, just like a squirrel. It also has brown fur and a long tail like a squirrel—but its a pygmy marmoset, the worlds smallest monkey!'),
  (1052, 'Ailurus fulgens', 'Red Panda', 'Many people admire the red panda for its charming, kitten-like face, cinnamon red fur, fluffy ringed tail, and astonishing agility. The black-and-white giant panda may have worldwide popularity, but the bewitching and arboreal “other bamboo eater” has its own allure. Surprisingly, red panda fossils have been discovered in North America that date as far back as 5 million years. Today, however, red pandas are only found in small, isolated mountain territories above 4,000 feet in China, Nepal, India, Bhutan, and Burma.'),
  (1053, 'Buteo jamaicensis', 'Red-Tailed Hawk', 'Red-tailed hawks are common in San Diego County and throughout North America, whether perched on a pole, soaring overhead, or just a distant, high-pitched "kkeeer..." heard from beyond the trees. These raptors, or birds of prey, have keen eyesight, binocular vision, powerful talons for grabbing prey, and a sharp beak. They are one of the largest North American hawk species and are commonly seen flying over rural areas from coast to coast.'),
  (1054, 'Pseudocheirus peregrinus', 'Ringtail Possum', 'Could you imagine spending most of your life in a tree house with your family? The common ringtail possum does exactly that! A strictly nocturnal animal, this marsupial spends little time on the ground and lots of time with its family. Ringtail possums are one of Australias most commonly encountered marsupials.'),
  (1055, 'Procavia capensis', 'Rock Hyrax', 'What is one of the closest living relatives of the elephant? If you said the manatee or dugong, which are both marine mammals, you would be correct. But there is another family member that is often forgotten: the hyrax (HI-racks)!'),
  (1056, 'Sagittarius serpentarius', 'Secretary Bird', 'The secretary bird’s English name was once thought to come from the 1800s, when Europeans first spotted these birds. Back then, male secretaries wore gray tailcoats and dark knee-length pants. They also used goose-quill pens that they carried behind their ears. This long-legged bird shares many of these same physical features: long, dark quills at the back of the head; long, gray wing and tail feathers that resemble a tailcoat; and black feathers that go midway down the legs like short pants. Its fun to imagine how the two "secretaries" compare!'),
  (1057, 'Leptailurus serval', 'Serval', '…he runs through a considerable space in an instant, and may be said only to appear and disappear…. This serval resembles the cat in its figure, and the tiger (that is the panther or leopard) by the black and white spot of its hair.—Count DeBuffon, Natural History, General and Particular, 1780.'),
  (1058, 'Symphalangus syndactylus', 'Siamang', 'Siamangs have slender bodies and lightweight bones for some serious swinging. These small, or lesser, apes are in the same scientific family as gibbons. Siamangs are the largest and darkest of the gibbon species and are well suited for life in a forest’s treetops. Yet there are some features on their hands and feet that make siamangs different from their gibbon brethren.'),
  (1059, 'Canis hallstromi', 'Singing Dog', 'The mossy, wet cloud forest on the island of New Guinea holds an ancient secret: a seldom seen, fiercely predatory wild canine called the New Guinea singing dog. Cute and perky, singing dogs are not exactly scary but rather like little pooches with big voices! They use their tuneful howling to communicate with other “singers.”'),
  (1060, 'Mecistops cataphractus', 'Slender-Snouted Crocodile', 'Built for stealth, the slender-snouted crocodile is an effective aquatic predator. With coloration that varies from brown to a grayish green, sometimes with black splotches, this crocodile is perfectly hidden in its watery home. Even its underside, with its creamy yellow color, makes it hard for potential prey swimming below the croc to see it coming.'),
  (1061, 'Ursus ursinus', 'Sloth Bear', 'Sloth bears are a bit misleading by name. They are not related to sloths, and they are not slow moving. In fact, they’re fairly agile bears that can run faster than a human and have been known to attack when surprised.'),
  (1062, 'Panthera uncia', 'Snow Leopard', 'Legendary snow leopards are rarely seen in the wild, as they live high in the mountains of Central Asia. Although the cats freely cross the international boundaries of 12 countries, their secretive behavior and remote habitat among the highest mountains in the world add to their mystery. Because of their shy behavior and uncanny, almost mystical ability to disappear among the rocks, snow leopards have entered the folklore of local peoples in many countries and have been described as shape-changing mountain spirits.'),
  (1063, 'Philetarius socius', 'Sociable Weavers', 'The sociable weaver is a common little brown bird in the Kalahari region of southern Africa. Yet this sparrow-sized critter may be one of the most interesting birds in the world! Sociable weavers are unlike most other birds due to their lifestyle and nest building. They weave one nest for their entire colony as well as for future residents.'),
  (1064, 'Equus asinus', 'Somali Wild Ass', 'Sleek, graceful, proud, and majestic, wild members of the horse family Equidae (horses, zebras, and wild asses) have long held a strong fascination for humans. All wild asses differ from horses and zebras in their smaller size, larger ears, tufted tail, stiff mane, and characteristic loud bray. Found in some of the most unlivable habitats of Africa and Asia, wild asses are able to eke out a living and thrive where most animals could not. African wild asses are divided into two subspecies: Somali and Nubian wild asses. Until recently, both were found in the wild, but it is possible that only the Somali wild ass remains.'),
  (1065, 'Crocuta crocuta', 'Spotted Hyena', 'So, you think you know all about spotted hyenas—the ones known to "laugh"? Theyre in lots of cartoons and movies, and theyre usually in the role of giggly villains. But is that a fair description?'),
  (1066, 'Hyaena hyaena', 'Striped Hyena', 'Hyenas are not members of the dog or cat families. Instead, they are so unique that they have a family all their own, Hyaenidae. There are four members of the Hyaenidae family: the striped hyena, the “giggly” spotted hyena, the brown hyena, and the aardwolf (it’s a hyena, not a wolf). These magnificent animals are sometimes called the scourge of the Serengeti, but they play an important role: cleanup crew!'),
  (1067, 'Helarctos malayanus', 'Sun Bear', 'The sun bear is the smallest of the worlds eight bear species, about half the size of the American black bear. Its common name comes from the white or yellowish crescent marking on its chest, which many people think looks like the rising or setting sun. Each bear’s crest is individual—like fingerprints.'),
  (1068, 'Pipa Pipa', 'Surinam Toad', 'The Surinam toad is a surprise from the first glance. Motionless in the water, you’d think it was a leaf or a rock, and that’s the idea! Its body is flat, its head is triangular, and its nostrils are at the end of two narrow tubes on its snout. The toad’s skin is pointy, rough, and is colored a mottled brown, tan, or olive. Each finger on its forelimbs has a tiny, star-shaped tip, leading to the animal’s other name, star-fingered toad. Yet despite its unique appearance, the Surinam toad’s reproductive strategy is what sets this amphibian apart. It’s freaky, but amazing, too!'),
  (1069, 'Budorcas taxicolor', 'Takin', 'With horns like a wildebeest, a nose like a moose, a tail like a bear, and a body like a bison, the takin (rhymes with rockin) looks like a character from Dr. Seuss! This large, muscular, hoofed mammal is sometimes referred to as a goat antelope, because it has things in common with both goats and antelope. But the takin is most closely related to sheep and to the goat-like aoudad, or Barbary sheep, of North Africa.'),
  (1070, 'Sarcophilus harrisii', 'Tasmanian Devil', 'The Tasmanian devil is NOT just a Loony Tunes cartoon character! It is a most unusual mammal, found only on the island state of Tasmania, a part of Australia. It is also a marsupial, related to koalas and kangaroos. Why the “fiery” name and reputation for an animal the size of a small dog? Devils are black in color and are said to have fierce tempers! Their oversize head, neck, and jaws are well suited to crushing bones. They make eerie growls while searching for food at night. And when a group of devils feeds together at a carcass, harsh screeching and spine-chilling screams can be heard.'),
  (1071, 'Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha', 'Thick-Billed Parrot', 'Think parrots live only in tropical climates? Endangered thick-billed parrots prefer higher elevations and make their home in the pine forests of northern Mexico. Because of their choice of habitat, they are sometimes called snow parrots or cold-weather parrots.'),
  (1072, 'Panthera tigris', 'Tiger', 'The beautiful, striped coat and that powerful, mesmerizing gaze make the tiger one of the world’s most revered animals. It’s a reverence that’s mixed with a bit of fear, an appropriate reaction to a large, well-muscled, swift hunter with inch-long claws and 3-inch-long (7 centimeter) canine teeth. The tiger is a stalk-and-ambush hunter, and the distinctive stripes are good camouflage in the long grass or wooded forests of their diverse habitat. Dark stripes on a pale background break up the tiger’s outline as it lies in wait for prey to come near.'),
  (1073, 'Manis tricuspis', 'Tree Pangolin', 'A pinecone with legs? An artichoke with a long tail? Yes, the pangolin is a unique-looking mammal! From the skinny, insect-seeking nose to the end of the scaled tail, the pangolin looks like an anteater from outer space! Pangolins are sometimes called scaly anteaters, but they aren’t related to anteaters. They are mammals in a family of their own.');
